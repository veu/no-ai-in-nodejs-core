# Petition to Node.js TSC: No AI code in Node.js Core

We, the undersigned, petition the Node.js Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
to vote **NO** on ["Is AI-assisted development allowed?"][0] and not accept
[LLM assisted rewrites of core internals][1].

Node.js is a _critical infrastructure_ running on millions of servers online and
supporting engineers through command-line utilities that they use daily. We
believe that diluting the core hand-written with _care and diligence_ over
the years is against the mission and values of the project and should not be
allowed. Accepting LLM changes to Node.js core would break the reputational
bedrock of public contributions that have brought Node.js to its current
public standing and societal value.

Submitted generated code should be reproducible by reviewers without having to
go through the paywall of subscription based LLM tooling.

## Background

[A 19k lines-of-code Pull Request][1] was opened in January, 2026. The 
[author][2] is a well known and long time contributor to Node.js core, but the 
Pull Request description has listed this sentence as a disclaimer:

> I've used a significant amount of Claude Code tokens to create this PR.
> I've reviewed all changes myself.

The [blog post][3] that surfaced on [Hacker News][4] that started a debate over 
whether a change like that even satisfies the requirements of 
[Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO)][5]:

```text
By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

 (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
     have the right to submit it under the open source license
     indicated in the file; or

 (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
     of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
     license and I have the right under that license to submit that
     work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
     by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
     permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
     in the file; or

 (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
     person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
     it.

 (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
     are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
     personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
     maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
     this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

and even though the [legal opinion of OpenJS foundation][6] is that LLM assisted
changes are not in violation of DCO, we believe that this is only a small part of
the issue with large LLM-written changes to the Node.js core.

Your signature is important in making sure our voices are heard and the decision
that TSC makes reflects the opinion of Node.js community.

You can sign this petition by opening a Pull Request and adding your name at the
bottom of this README.md file or alternatively opening an issue.

Pull Requests will be merged throughout the day, but might be merged in bulk to
speed up the process.
